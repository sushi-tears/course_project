# React Native Course Project
## Interface Design II Lab

This project contains an updated design for Micro Center's  website seen here: https://www.microcenter.com

The idea was to cut down on the bloat and help the site feel more fluid and consistent between pages. For this reason I used ReactSPA to keep the design consistent across the application.
